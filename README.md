Should have been an Android app to open location based temporary stores.

Now just an app that retrieves the current location and display the address using the new Play Services API (v11). 

A big thanks to Google for not releasing an AVD image with the compatible Play Services version and just updating the Location tutorial. And how easy is to update Play Services on the AVD!!!
